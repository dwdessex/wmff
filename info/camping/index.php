</div>

<h2 class="maintitle">Camping</h2>
<p>Our official campsite is Meadows Camping, a picturesque, local, secure, well managed temporary campsite for the folk festival weekend. The site is just a 10 minute walk from the town centre over Julian's bridge.</p>

<p>Camping at Meadows Campsite this year is <strong>&#163;7.50</strong> per person per night (+ booking fee) when booked in advance online or <strong>&#163;8.50</strong> per person per night on the gate. Under 10's are free.</p>

<p>The site has toilets, showers and good 24 hour security. Entry to the campsite is by camping wristband only, which is available through our <a href="http://ticketsource.co.uk/wimbornefolk" rel="tag"><strong>Online Box Office</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Please be aware that access to/from the town on foot is over Julian's bridge, which has no footpath, so please take care when crossing at all times.</p>
